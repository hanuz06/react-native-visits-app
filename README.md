# Places tracker

This is a React Native app that allows to keep a list of visited places. A user can input a title, add a picture with camera, and add location with Google Map. The user can tap on any item in the list to see the details (title, picture, and map image), and by taping on the map image the user will be able to see full screen non-editable map with marker on it. Each item in the list is deletable by long pressing on the item.
